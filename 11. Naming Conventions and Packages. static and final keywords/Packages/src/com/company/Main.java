         * Why packages?
         *
         * Programmers can easily determine which classes are related.
         *
         * It's easy to know where to find classes and interfaces that
         * can provide the functions provided by the package.
         *
         * Because the package creates a new namespace, class and
         * interfaces name conflicts are avoided.
         *
         * Classes within the package can have unrestricted access
         * to one another while still restricting access for
         * classes outside the package.
