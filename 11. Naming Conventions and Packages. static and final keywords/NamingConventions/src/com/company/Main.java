	    ------ Naming Conventions: ------

	    Packages - Always lower case. Should be unique. Internet domain name, reversed, as a prefix
        Domain invalid characters use underscore as well when the domain starts with a number. Java keywords should also start with an underscore.
        Classes - CamelCase. Nouns. Start with a capital letter. Each word in the name should start with a capital letter (LinkedList)
        Interfaces - CamelCase. Consider what the object will become or will be able to do when naming (List, Comparable, Serializeable)
        Methods - mixedCase. Often verbs. Reflect the function performed or the result returned. size() getName() addPlayer()
        Constants - ALL UPPER CASE. Seperate words with underscore '_'. Declared using the final keyword
        Variables - mixedCase. Meaningful and indicative. Start with lower case letter. Do not use underscores '_'. (i, league, sydneySwans, boxLength)
        Type Parameters - single Character, capital letters. (E - Element, K - Key, T - Type, V - Value, S|U|V|ect - 2nd|3rd|4th types)
